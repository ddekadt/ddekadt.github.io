## current and prospective students

If you are interested in working with me for your PhD, feel free to get in touch over email and I will do my best to respond. 

Note that I do not control admissions -- please also consult the department website for information about the application process.

If you are a past or current student and would like to request a letter of reference, please email me as soon as you can. Please also prepare a package (preferably a shared Google drive that you can update dynamically) that includes:
- your up-to-date CV
- any available transcripts
- draft statements of purpose and writing samples
- a spreadsheet of relevant programs and deadlines
- a one page memo that highlights any important points in our relationship, or additional information you would like me to consider as I write your letter
