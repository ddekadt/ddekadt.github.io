## private consulting

I have extensive experience in the application of causal inference in industry for better decision making, and in building causal inference competence within teams.

I am also available for private consulting work on topics related to electoral politics and South African politics. I write regularly on these topics for leading news media outlets, and have appeared on television to discuss South African politics.

If you are interested in my services, please reach out over email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-de-kadt-7091964/).
