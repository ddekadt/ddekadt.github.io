I'm a social and data scientist interested in issues surrounding politics, elections, voting, democracy, and South Africa.

My research uses quantitative methods — including experiments, quasi-experiments, and machine learning — to study democratic accountability, electoral access, and the politics of inequality, primarily in the South African context.
