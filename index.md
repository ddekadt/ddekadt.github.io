I'm a social and data scientist with 15 years of expertise in the design and application of causal inference and machine learning techniques in ambiguous and complex settings.

I am substantively interested in democracy, inequality, and the politics of South Africa, and also work on issues of meta-science and causal inference.

I am currently a faculty member at the London School of Economics, before which I worked at the University of California, Merced. My PhD is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 2021 through 2023 I worked in the Data Science vertical at Deliveroo.
